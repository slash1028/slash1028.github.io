# Sub3Vox Project

---

*The aim of the Sub3Vox project is collecting a new database for text-dependent, text-prompted, and text-independent speaker recognition, as well as for Persian speech recognition.*

## Sub3Vox Corpus

The Sub3Vox, a new English corpus, is introduced for TD-SV. It was created from a TI-SV dataset in an automated pipeline and is larger than any existing TD-SV corpora. This is the first time that a TD-SV corpus has been created from a TI-SV corpus. The characteristics of the Sub3Vox are analyzed, and its baseline performance is reported.

  In the paper, we propose an automatic pipeline to curate TD-SV corpora from TI-SV corpora, which addresses the shortcomings of the existing TD corpora not being large enough and saves the effort in manual recording.

## How and When you can access the database

As mentioned before, the project is running now and the first phase of it should be finished by the end of summer. If you are interested in the unprocessed data, we can provide access to the last snapshot of the database. You can communicate with us to discuss about this possibility.

## News and Updates

- **Sep 2024**：Our paper "Denoising Student Features with Diffusion Models for Knowledge Distillation in Speaker Verification" has been submitted to the Main Tracks of the [2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/). See you in Hyderabad, India!
- **May 2024**：We curated our first Sub3Vox corpus from VoxCeleb1!
