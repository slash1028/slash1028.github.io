# Sub3Project

---

*This paper introduces the sub-3sec problem in speaker verification, a short-duration task rarely explored. The issue arises from labor-intensive annotations and costly recordings for textdependent speaker verification (TD-SV) corpora. To address this issue, we propose an automatic pipeline to extract short phrases from text-independent speaker verification (TI-SV) corpora.*

## Sub3Vox Corpus

This work introduces the Sub3Vox, a novel English corpus for TD-SV. It was generated from a TI-SV dataset by a novel automated pipeline and is larger than any existing TD-SV corpora. Notably, this is the first time that a TD-SV corpus has been created from a TI-SV corpus. We further analyze the characteristics of Sub3Vox and report its baseline performance. The proposed pipeline can be applied to other TI-SV datasets, offering a scalable solution for generating large TD-SV corpora.

## How and When you can access the database

The data in Sub3Vox1 will be available soon.
